\abstract{
    A \gls{cps} can be described as a network of interlinked, concurrent computational components that interact with the physical world.
    Such a system is usually of reactive nature and must satisfy strict timing requirements to guarantee a correct behaviour.
    The components can be of mixed-criticality which implies different progress models and communication models, depending whether the focus of a component lies on predictability or resource efficiency.

    In this dissertation I present a novel approach that bridges the gap between stream processing models and \glspl{lts}.
    The former offer powerful tools to describe concurrent systems of, usually simple, components while the latter allow to describe complex, reactive, components and their mutual interaction.
    In order to achieve the bridge between the two domains I introduce the novel \gls{lts} \emph{\gls{sia}} that allows to model the interaction protocol of a process via its interface and to incrementally compose simple processes into more complex ones while preserving the system properties.
    Exploiting these properties I introduce an analysis to identify permanent blocking situations in a network of composed processes.
    \Glspl{sia} are wrapped by the novel component-based coordination model \emph{\gls{pnsc}} that allows to describe a network of concurrent processes where multiple communication models and the co-existence and interaction of heterogeneous processes is supported due to well defined interfaces.

    The work presented in this dissertation follows a holistic approach which spans from the theory of the underlying model to an instantiation of the model as a novel coordination language, called \emph{\gls*{smx}}.
    The language uses network operators to compose networks of concurrent processes in a structured and hierarchical way.
    The work is validated by a prototype implementation of a compiler and a \gls{rts} that allows to compile a \gls*{smx} program and execute it on a platform with support for ISO C, POSIX threads, and a Linux operating system.

\acknowledgements{
    First, my gratitude goes to the University of Hertfordshire for providing the funding and infrastructure for my PhD and for giving me the opportunity to start a career in academia.

    I would like to thank my primary supervisor and research mentor Dr~Raimund Kirner for the support of my PhD and related research.
    I am grateful for his commitment to provide me with guidance even late at night or on weekends.
    His broad knowledge and his patience were a huge help throughout the whole of the PhD.

    Further, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr~Olga Tveretina, my secondary supervisor, for her valuable inputs and her mental support.
    My thanks also go to Dr~Prof~Alex Shafarenko, leader of the research group \groupname, for his invaluable feedback.

    I thank Giovina for her patience and her interest in abstract topics that are not hers.
    Her cheerful and supportive attitude were a big help throughout this project and I am ever grateful to her for leading me onto this path.
    Her hilarious personifications of certain aspects of my work, complete with pictures and all, is only one of many examples of her brilliant way of supporting me.

    Although I do not know these people personally I want to give a shout out to Randall Munroe for his book "Thing Exaplainer - Complicated Stuff in Simple Words", showing that complicated things can be explained with only a 1000 words and Linda Liukas, for her book "Hello Ruby", advocating the fact that computer science is not as difficult as common belief suggests and that it can be taught to anyone.

    Last but not least, I want to thank my family and friends from abroad for their continuous support and their willingness to pay us visit on a regular basis.
    % I cannot stress enough how much I appreciated
